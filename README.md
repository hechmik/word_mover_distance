# Word Mover's Distance
In this repository you will find the implementation of Word Mover's Distance for a generic Word Embeddings model.

What I've done is to largely reuse code available in the [gensim](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim) library but making it more general so that it can be used with other Word Embeddings models, such as [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).
